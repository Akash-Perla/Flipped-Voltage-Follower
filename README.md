# Flipped-Voltage-Follower

This is our attempt to replicate Flipped Voltage Follower given in the paper "Flipped Voltage Follower Low Dropout (LDO) Voltage Regulators: A Tutorial Overview." which was published in the 2018 31th International Conference on VLSI Design and 2018 17th International Conference on Embedded Systems.

### Project

We have used gptk90 for our simulation. Please run the matlab codes present in the folder `Techplots_90` for generating the techplots.
Additionally, refer to the `FVF_Final_Report.pdf` for further details regarding implementation.
