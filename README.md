# Flipped-Voltage-Follower

This is our attempt to replicate Flipped Voltage Follower given in the paper "Flipped Voltage Follower Low Dropout (LDO) Voltage Regulators: A Tutorial Overview." which was published in the 2018 31th International Conference on VLSI Design and 2018 17th International Conference on Embedded Systems.

### Project

All the circuits were simulated using Cadence Virtuoso and we have used gptk90 for our simulation. To generate the techplots, please run the MATLAB codes located in the `Techplots_90` folder.

For additional details on the implementation, refer to the `FVF_Final_Report.pdf`. The `Sizing_sheet.xlsx` file provides the sizes of all FETs used in the circuits.

Please feel free to raise any issues.
